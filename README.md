# react-portfolio


## Requirements

* Updated portfolio featuring 6 total projects
* Use React
* A `Header` component that appears on multiple pages
* A single `Project` component that will be used multiple times on a single page 
* Navigation with React Router, dynamic rendering, or another third part router
* A `Footer` component that appears on multiple pages
* Update GitHub profile with pinned repositories featuring those same projects
* Deploy this site to GitHub Pages using the [Create React App docs for deployment.](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages)
* **Important**: Be sure to push your codebase to GitHub and **NOT** your built and deployed code. Ensure this happens by following the above instructions and using the `gh-pages` branch to host the deployed application's code.

### Updated Portfolio

Your updated site should still have all of the content it previously had:

* Your name
* Links to your GitHub profile & LinkedIn page as well as your email address and phone number
* A link to a PDF of your resume with updated projects
* A list of projects. For each project, make sure you have the following:
  * Project title
  * Link to the deployed version
  * Link to the GitHub repository
  * GIF or screenshot of the deployed application

#### Design

As with the previous portfolio homework, "good" design is subjective. Your site should look
"polished." Here are a few guidelines on what that means:

* Mobile-first design
* Choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.
* Make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.
* If you want to go above and beyond, try using animations and react component libraries. Note 
that this will _not_ affect your grade, but it may impact how potentials employers gauge your knowledge.

### React

Additionally, this new portfolio should be created using React.
At a minimum, your portfolio should include the following:
* A `Header` component that appears on multiple pages
* A single `Project` component that will be used multiple times on a single page 
* Navigation with React Router, dynamic rendering, or another third part router
* A `Footer` component that appears on multiple pages
* **Important**: If you use React Router, you will **NOT** be able to use the `<BrowserRouter>` component on GitHub Pages. Read the [GitHub note on client-side routing](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#notes-on-client-side-routing) and the [React Router documentation on HashRouter](https://reactrouter.com/web/api/HashRouter) for more information.

### Updated LinkedIn Profile 

Updated LinkedIn Profile with the new skills you've acquired since the last time it was updated.
